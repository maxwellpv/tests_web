feature: PostPublicationsServiceTest 	

	As a developer
	I want to create a new publication through an API
	So that i dont have to manually create one in the database.

Background: 
	
	Given the endpoint http://localhost:5000/api/v1/publications is available
@Publication_Creation
Scenario: Create Publications

	When a POST Request is sent with body
	| publicationType | title                  | content                                                                       | participantLimit | prizePool | tDate     | tHour | urlToImage | publicatedAt             | gameId | userId |

	Then a Response with Status 200 is received
	And a Publication Resource is included in the response body.
	| id | publicationType | title                  | content                                                                       | participantLimit | prizePool | tDate     | tHour | urlToImage | publicatedAt             | gameId | userId |
